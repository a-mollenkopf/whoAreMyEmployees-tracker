# Features

This project furthered my knowledge of CLI and the use of node to do so. It helped me grasp mySQL and how to create tables and add information into those tables. I was having a little bit of trouble getting the update employee role to work as well as the view all employees. It shows the list of names 3 times in a row and I can't seem to figure out why. It also isnt updating all of my columns. It only shows the first 4.
